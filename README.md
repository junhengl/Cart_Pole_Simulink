## Simulation Guide

1. Download all files in this repo
2. Download CasADi Library for Matlab, for your system
3. In Matlab, add files from step 1&2 to path, including subfolders
4. Open Cart_Pole.slx, this is main simulation
5. Open and run startUp.m
6. Configure your controller in startUp and simulink model and run the simulation.
